> My first React project — where I planted my roots into the React ecosystem.

## 🧭 Why I Built This

This project marks the **beginning of my journey into React**. Coming from a .NET + Angular background, I wanted to **learn React by building**, not just reading docs.

I didn’t want to create just another "To-Do App". Instead, I built a **Habit Garden** — where every habit is a seed, and every daily action helps it grow. It was a way for me to internalize the **React mental model**, while creating something visually playful and emotionally satisfying.

## 🌱 What I Learned

Building Habit Garden helped me understand and apply key React fundamentals:

| Concept                     | What I Took Away |
|-----------------------------|------------------|
| `useState`                  | How component-level memory works in function components |
| `useEffect`                 | When and why to use side effects like syncing with local storage |
| JSX                         | Learned how JSX differs from HTML and why it compiles to `React.createElement` |
| Props & Lifting State       | Understood top-down data flow and how to keep logic centralized |
| Component Design            | Practiced separating smart/dumb components |
| CSS Modules                 | Avoided global CSS, scoped my styles cleanly |
